                  To make an instance store volume available on Linux

1. Connect to the instance using an SSH client. 

2. Use the df -h command to view the volumes that are formatted and mounted.

[ec2-user ~]$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        3.8G   72K  3.8G   1% /dev
tmpfs           3.8G     0  3.8G   0% /dev/shm
/dev/nvme0n1p1  7.9G  1.2G  6.6G  15% /

3. Use the lsblk to view any volumes that were mapped at launch but not formatted and mounted.

[ec2-user ~]$ lsblk
NAME          MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1       259:1    0    8G  0 disk
├─nvme0n1p1   259:2    0    8G  0 part /
└─nvme0n1p128 259:3    0    1M  0 part
nvme1n1       259:0    0 69.9G  0 disk

4. To format and mount an instance store volume that was mapped only, do the following:
Create a file system on the device using the mkfs command.

[ec2-user ~]$ sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo mkdir /data
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /data
