Create an IAM policy to control access to Amazon EC2 resources based on tags

Scenario:
We want to allow developers that are working on project1 to
have control over their own EC2 instances.

1- Select your instance from the EC2 console

2- In the Tags menu in the bottom pane, click Add/Edit tags and add "Team" as key and add "Project1" as value

3- Open IAM and click Users and create a user called Jim and him to a new group called project1

4- On the left click policies and then click "Create Policy"

5- In the JSON tab, allow access to the EC2 console. Use describe statement for this purpose. 
Copy the following code between "Statement"[].

{
	"Sid": "DescribeInstances",
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Action": [
		"ec2:Describe*"
		],
		"Resource": "*"
}

6- Add a new statement to allow Project1 team to control the ec2 instances for the project

{
	"Sid": "ControlingEC2instancesProject1",
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Action": [
		"ec2:RebootInstances",
		"ec2:StartInstances",
		"ec2:StopInstances"
		],
		"Resource": "*",
		"Condition": {
			"StringEquals": {
				"ec2:ResourceTag/Team": "Project1"
			}
		}
}

7- Name the policy "EC2-Project1-Policy"

8- Attach the policy to the project1 group by clicking on policy actions and selecting attach.

9- If we sign in as the project1 member we can only perform operations that are assigned to this group.
