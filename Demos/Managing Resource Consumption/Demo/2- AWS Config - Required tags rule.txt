AWS Config Required Tags rule

Add this rule to audit which resources are lacking a certain tag.

For example we want to make sure all ec2 instances have an Department tag, and
if they don't, we will audit using AWS config.

1- Open AWS config
2- Select rules and click "Add rule" 
3- Select "AWS Managed Rules"
4- Search for rule named "required-tags", select and hit next
5- Give it a unique name
6- Under "Trigger" select "AWS EC2 Instance" and remove the rest
7- Under "Parameters", in front of "tag1Key", Place the key name you're looking for.
In this case we're looking for "Department" key and remove the rest.
8- Click add rule to start evaluation.
